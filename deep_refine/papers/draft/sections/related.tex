The papers also do the refinement on \deeppoly{} are \deepsrgr{}~\cite{yang2021improving} and
\kpoly{}~\cite{singh2019beyond}, 
although these papers do not do the cegar-based refinement. The approach \kpoly{} considers 
a group of neurons at once to generate the constraints and compute the bounds of neurons. 
The approach \deepsrgr{} removes the 
spurious region by taking each neuron's constraints with the negation of the property and using the 
\textsc{Gurobi}~\cite{gurobioptimizer} optimizer to tighten the bounds of each neuron. 
As per our knowledge elbohar et al~\cite{elboher2020abstraction} and \narv{}~\cite{liu2022abstraction} 
do the cegar-based refinement, but their abstraction techniques are orthogonal to \deeppoly{}. 
They reduce the network size by merging similar 
neurons with over-approximation, while \deeppoly{} maintains the linear constraints for each neuron without changing the 
structure of the network. Paper~\cite{lin2020art} do the refinement by bisecting the input space on the guided dimension. 
Our approach exploits the incomplete technique \deeppoly{},
which scales well, but if it fails to verify then we do the cegar-based refinement.

%  In general neural network verification techniques can be classify broadly in two categories, 
%  complete and incomplete techniques. The techniques \cite{lomuscio2017approach}, \cite{fischetti2018deep},
%  \cite{dutta2018output}, \cite{cheng2017maximum}, \cite{katz2017reluplex}, \cite{katz2019marabou}, 
%  \cite{ehlers2017formal}, \cite{huang2017safety}, \cite{wang2021beta}, \cite{xu2020fast}, \cite{zhang2022general}
%  are the complete techniques. Techniques which either return \texttt{verified} or a counter example 
%  are known as complete techniques. 
%  The complete techniques explore the exact state space, hence, they suffers with scalability issues on the large 
%  size of networks. On the other hand, the techniques \cite{dvijotham2018dual}, \cite{gehr2018ai2}, \cite{singh2018fast},
%  \cite{singh2018boosting}, \cite{weng2018towards}, \cite{wong2018provable}, \cite{zhang2018efficient}, \cite{zhang2018efficient}
%  are the sound and incomplete techniques. The incomplete techniques usually over approximate the state space, hence, 
%  these techniques scale well but do not remain complete. Our approach exploit the incomplete technique \deeppoly{},
%  which scale well, but if it fails to find the counter example then we do the cegar based refinement.
