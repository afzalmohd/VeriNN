 The papers also do the refinement on \deeppoly{} are \cite{deepsrgr} and \cite{refinepoly}, although these papers
 do not do the cegar based refinement. As per our knowledge elbohar et al~\cite{4class}, 
 ~\cite{4class1} and ~\cite{4class2} do the cegar based refinement, but their abstraction technique reduces the network
 size by merging the similar neurons with over-approximation.
