We have presented a novel cegar-based approach, which results in a scalable and efficient approach.  Our approach comprises two parts. One part finds the causes of spuriousness, while the other parts refine  the information found in the first part. Experimental evaluation shows that we outperform related refinement techniques, in terms of efficiency and effectivity. We are also verify several benchmarks that are beyond state of the art solvers, highly optimized solvers.
As futurework, we plan to extend our technique/tool to make it independent of \deeppoly{} and applicable with other abstraction based techniques and tools. %We believe this could lead to more benchmarks being solved overall.
 %Such that we can improve the results on top of the state of the arts.
