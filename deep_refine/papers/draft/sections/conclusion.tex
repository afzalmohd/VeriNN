We have presented a novel cegar based approach, which results into a scalable and efficient approach. 
Our approach comprises of two parts. One part finds the causes of spuriousness, while other parts refine 
the information found in first part. We have two-two approaches for both parts. 
Experimental evaluation shows that we are performing better in comparison to the related refinement techniques, 
in terms of efficiency and effectivity. We are also verifying the reasonable number of unique benchmarks
in comparison to the state of the arts. 

Experiments shows that the number of marked neurons are quite small, so, 
we can say that refinement algorithms are not taking much time.
In future improving the time of {\em "finding causes of spuriousness"} algorithms improve the overall efficiency.    
We also plan to make it a general refinement framework i.e. independent of \deeppoly{}. Such that 
we can improve the results on top of the state of the arts.
