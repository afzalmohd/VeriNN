We have presented a novel cegar-based approach, which results in a scalable and efficient approach.  Our approach comprises two parts. One part finds the causes of spuriousness, while the other parts refine  the information found in the first part. Experimental evaluation shows that we outperform related refinement techniques, in terms of efficiency and effectivity. We are also verify several benchmarks that are beyond state of the art solvers, highly optimized portfolio solvers.

 %Such that we can improve the results on top of the state of the arts.
