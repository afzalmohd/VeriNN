\begin{abstract}
  Increasingly, people are using neural networks for important
  safety-critical systems, e. g., autonomous vehicles,
  medical diagnosis, and speech recognition.
  % Neural networks have achieved an important role in 
  %
  However, a malicious actor can easily
  mislead state-of-the-art networks
  by carefully making small modifications in input.
  %
  We need neural networks that do not change their output
  under small perturbations in inputs.
  %
  The researchers are developing techniques to formally
  verify that a network satisfies the property.
  %
  % The researchers found a need here to formally verify
  % the desired properties of the neural networks.
  % % 
  The neural network verification problem is an NP-hard problem.
  %
  Therefore, the practical verification methods need to resolve the
  trade-off between scalability and precision.
  %
  The leading methods that scale on real-world
  networks are based on the abstraction-based approach.
  %
  The methods suffer from imprecision.
  %
  In this paper, % we remove imprecision using
  % guided refinement of the abstraction.
  % %
  we present a {\em novel} counterexample guided abstraction
  refinement method on top of abstraction \deeppoly{} to remove
  the imprecision.  
  % 
  We have implemented the method as a prototype.
  %
  We compare the performance of our tool against leading tools from VNNCOMP 2021.
  %
  Our experiments show that we can solve 172
  verification problems that none of the tools
  can solve.
  % Our experiments show that we are outperforming in comparison
  % to the related refinement techniques, also verifying the more
  % number of unique
  % benchmarks on which the state of the arts fails to verify.
