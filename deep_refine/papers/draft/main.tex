\begin{abstract}
       Neural networks have achieved an important role in safety-
       critical systems, e. g., autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and speech
       recognition. However, even the state of the arts network can easily be
       fooled by carefully making small modifications in input. The researchers
       found a need here to formally verify the desired properties of the neural net-
       works. The neural network verification problem is an NP-hard problem.
       Therefore, practical methods need to resolve the trade-off between scalability and precision. The state of the arts, which scales on the real-world
       networks are based on the abstraction-based approach. These tools suffer
       from imprecision. We are trying to remove imprecision by refining the
       abstraction. The tool on which our method work is \deeppoly{}. Our experiments show that we are outperforming in comparison to the related
       refinement techniques, also verifying the reasonable number of unique
       benchmarks on which the state of the arts fails to verify.
